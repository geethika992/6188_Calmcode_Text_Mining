**KNN Regressor for Diamonds Dataset**:

Dataset- diamonds.csv

This project employs a KNN regressor to predict diamond prices from their attributes using the Diamonds dataset. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and encoding categorical variables. The model is built by splitting data into training and testing sets, implementing the regressor, and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance. Model evaluation includes assessing performance using regression metrics and visualizing actual vs. predicted prices.

**Lunr Search Implementation**:
Utilizing the Lunr JavaScript library, this project demonstrates efficient full-text search functionality in web applications. Text data is prepared, indexed, and searched using Lunr, enabling fast retrieval of relevant documents and enhancing user experience with accurate search capabilities.
